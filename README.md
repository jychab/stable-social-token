## Motivation
The current landscape of creator coins is characterized by extreme volatility, making it challenging to price goods and services reliably. Businesses accepting these crypto tokens as payment risk significant value fluctuations, potentially incurring losses when converting them to cover costs. This instability undermines the practicality of using such tokens for consistent and dependable transactions. Furthermore, stablecoins like USDC do not offer significant advantages over traditional, well-established payment methods. To address these issues, we have introduced the concept of a brandable stablecoin that allows creators to capture transfer fees, providing a more stable and profitable payment solution.

## Idea
We propose a smart contract that ensures that new tokens can only be minted by locking an equivalent value of USDC (a stablecoin) in a secure vault. The backing by USDC stabilizes the token's value, ensuring it remains approximately equal to the value of the locked stablecoins. 

## Features

- Stable Value: Each token is backed by USDC, ensuring its value remains stable and reducing the risk of significant price fluctuations.
- Creator Fees: Creators can set a transfer fee for their token, earning a small fee whenever the token is used for transactions.
- Minting and Redeeming: Tokens can only be minted by depositing USDC into the vault, and they can be exchanged back to USDC, ensuring liquidity and value stability.

This model offers a more stable and reliable crypto token for creators, allowing them to confidently price their goods and services without the fear of losing value due to market volatility. The ability to earn transfer fees also provides creators with an additional revenue stream, incentivizing the use of their tokens in commerce.
