## Motivation
The current landscape of memecoins is marked by extreme volatility, making it difficult to use them to price goods and services reliably. Businesses accepting crypto tokens as payment face the risk of fluctuating values, potentially incurring losses when converting them to cover costs. This instability undermines the practicality of using such tokens for consistent and dependable transactions.

## Idea
To address this issue, we propose a smart contract that ensures that new tokens can only be minted by locking an equivalent value of USDC (a stablecoin) in a secure vault. The backing by USDC stabilizes the token's value, ensuring it remains approximately equal to the value of the locked stablecoins. 

## Features

- Stable Value: Each token is backed by USDC, ensuring its value remains stable and reducing the risk of significant price fluctuations.
- Creator Fees: Creators can set a transfer fee for their token, earning a small fee whenever the token is used for transactions.
- Minting and Redeeming: Tokens can only be minted by depositing USDC into the vault, and they can be exchanged back to USDC, ensuring liquidity and value stability.

This model offers a more stable and reliable crypto token for creators, allowing them to confidently price their goods and services without the fear of losing value due to market volatility. The ability to earn transfer fees also provides creators with an additional revenue stream, incentivizing the use of their tokens in commerce.
