## Motivation
Businesses accepting crypto tokens as payments face significant value fluctuations, making it impractical for pricing goods & services. While stablecoins like USDC offer low-cost transactions, cost alone is not sufficient to differentiate them from traditional payment methods. 

## Idea
A smart contract mints tokens by locking an equivalent value of stablecoin in a program escrow. By utilizing token extensions such as transfer fees and transfer hooks, creators can add features to their tokens while value remains stable due to the stablecoin backing it.

## Features

- Stable Value: Each token is backed by USDC, ensuring its value remains stable and reducing the risk of significant price fluctuations.
- Creator Fees: Creators can set a transfer fee for their token, earning a small fee whenever the token is used for transactions.
- Minting and Redeeming: Tokens can only be minted by depositing USDC into the vault, and they can be exchanged back to USDC, ensuring liquidity and value stability.

This model provides creators with a more stable and reliable crypto token, enabling them to confidently price their goods and services without fear of value loss due to market volatility. Additionally, the ability to earn transfer fees allows creators to monetize and reward their loyal token holders.
